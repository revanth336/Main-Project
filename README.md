## Project Overview

The increasing metropolitan cities and the growing number of vehicles have led to significant challenges in managing parking spaces effectively and ensuring the security of parked vehicles. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive prototype of an Advanced Parking System that utilizes an IoT model and framework. This project aims to provide a seamless parking experience for users while optimizing parking space utilization and enhancing overall security measures.

## Research Objectives

### Objective 1:

Develop an IoT-based system that can accurately and efficiently detect parking slot availability in a defined parking area, providing real-time information to users and developing the Automated Gate System.

### Objective 2:

Extend the above setup to develop an effective parking management system using a sensor mechanism to detect and address improper parking instances and implement a Slot Booking System using a software platform.

## Methodology

The methodology of the IoT-Based Advanced Parking System involves a multifaceted approach to urban parking management:

1. **Sensor Deployment**:

   - **Technologies Used**: Utilize cutting-edge technologies like ultrasonic or infrared sensors to detect real-time parking slot availability and identify improper parking instances.
   - **Strategic Placement**: Sensors are strategically placed in each parking slot to monitor availability and detect vehicles.

2. **Data Transmission**:

   - **Wireless Communication**: Collect data from sensors and transmit it wirelessly to a central IoT platform for processing and analysis using Wi-Fi or other wireless technologies.
   - **Central IoT Platform**: The central IoT platform acts as the intelligence hub for processing and analyzing the data collected by sensors.

3. **Gate System Integration**:

   - **Secure Entry/Exit**: Ensure secure entry and exit regulation based on real-time parking conditions.
   - **Automated Gates**: Use servo motors to control the gates, which open or close based on the availability of parking slots.

4. **User Interaction**:

   - **Blynk Application**: Facilitate user interaction through Blynk applications, allowing seamless access to real-time parking information and the convenience of reserving parking slots in advance.
   - **User Interface**: The user interface provides real-time updates on slot availability and allows users to book slots.

5. **Sensor Mechanism for Improper Parking Detection**:

   - **Detection**: Detect improper parking, triggering immediate real-time alerts for swift intervention.
   - **Types of Violations**: Violations such as occupying multiple slots, parking in restricted zones, or exceeding time limits trigger immediate alerts.
   - **Alert System**: Security personnel or administrators receive real-time notifications as a buzzer alert to address improper parking instances promptly.

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation**:
   - **Hardware and Software Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring to ensure optimal performance of both hardware and software components.
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Use evaluation metrics such as traffic congestion reduction, user satisfaction, and parking information accuracy for ongoing improvements and updates.
